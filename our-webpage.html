			<h2> Spaghetti Carbonara </h2>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0px; text-align: justify;"> Carbonara is an Italian pasta dish from Rome made with egg, hard cheese, cured pork, and black pepper. The dish arrived at its modern form, with its current name, in the middle of the 20th century. <br> <br>
			The cheese is usually Pecorino Romano, Parmigiano-Reggiano, or a combination of the two. Spaghetti is the most common pasta, but fettuccine, rigatoni, linguine, or bucatini are also used. Normally guanciale or pancetta are used for the meat component, but lardons of smoked bacon are a common substitute outside Italy. </p>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 10px;"> Preparation </h2>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0px; text-align: justify;">The pasta is cooked in moderately salted boiling water. The guanciale is briefly fried in a pan in its own fat. A mixture of raw eggs, grated Pecorino, and a liberal amount of ground black pepper is combined with the hot pasta either in the pasta pot or in a serving dish, but away from direct heat, to avoid curdling the egg. The fried guanciale is then added, and the mixture is tossed, creating a rich, creamy sauce with bits of meat spread throughout. Although various shapes of pasta can be used, the raw egg can only cook properly with a shape that has a sufficiently large ratio of surface area to volume, such as the long, thin types fettucine, linguine, or spaghetti. <br> <br>

			<h2> Pizza Margherita </h2>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0px; text-align: justify;"> Pizza Margherita is a typical Neapolitan pizza, made with San Marzano tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, salt and extra-virgin olive oil. Traditionally, it is made with fior di latte (cow's milk mozzarella) rather than buffalo mozzarella. </p>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 10px;"> History </h2>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0px; text-align: justify;">A widespread belief says that in June 1889 the pizza-maker Raffaele Esposito, Pizzeria Brandi's chef, invented a dish called "Pizza Margherita" in honor of the Queen of Italy, Margherita of Savoy, and the Italian unification, since toppings are tomato (red), mozzarella (white) and basil (green), representing the same colors of the national flag of Italy. <br> <br>
			The legend of pizza Margherita is considered a false history, as a pizza made with the same toppings was already present in Naples between 1796 and 1810, although it probably was not called "Margherita". In 1830, in the book <em>Napoli, contorni e dintorni</em>, written by Riccio, it was described as a pizza with tomato, mozzarella and basil. In 1849, Emanuele Rocco recorded different pizza toppings like basil, tomatoes, and thin slices of mozzarella; the mozzarella was thinly sliced, and arranged with a flower-shape over the tomato sauce, along with the basil leaves: this may be the real origin of the name Margherita (meaning daisy).<br> <br>

			<h2> Churros </h2>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0px; text-align: justify;"> A churro is a fried-dough pastry—predominantly choux—based snack. In Spain, churros can either be thin (and sometimes knotted) or long and thick, where they are known as porras in some regions. They are normally eaten for breakfast dipped in champurrado, hot chocolate, dulce de leche or café con leche. Sugar is often sprinkled on top.</p>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 10px;"> Preparation </h2>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0px; text-align: justify;"> Churros are fried until they become crunchy, and may be sprinkled with sugar or chocolate. The surface of a churro is ridged due to having been piped from a churrera, a syringe-like tool with a star-shaped nozzle. Churros are generally prisms in shape, and may be straight, curled or spirally twisted. The dough is a mixture of flour, water and salt. Some versions are made of potato dough. <br> <br>
			Like pretzels, churros are sold by street vendors, who may fry them freshly on the street stand and sell them hot. Specialized churrerías, in the form of a shop or a trailer, can be found on the streets. <br> <br>
